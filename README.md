# Description

In this study, we examined differences in atopic comorbidities related to emergency department (ED) recurrent encounters, using individual-level factors and place-based exposures.

We determined the probability of ED encounterfree survival time using hazard ratios (HRs) and time to recurrence (TTR) of ED encounter using Bayesian survival models.
